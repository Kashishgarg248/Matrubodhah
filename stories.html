        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty (304–232 BCE) ruled most of the Indian subcontinent. Though he was a great warrior, the bloodbath of the Kalinga War transformed him. Ashoka was overcome by the suffering that his ambition had caused. He embraced Buddhism and renounced violence. He adopted a policy of "Dhamma" or righteousness. He built stupas, spread Buddhist teachings across Asia, and worked for social welfare. Ashoka is a powerful example of how regret can be used to achieve redemption and a permanent legacy of peace.</p>
